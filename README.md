Erlang Port Mapper Daemon
=========================

An Erlang implmentation of Erlang/OTPs port mapper daemon.

The Erlang code was originally written by Peer Stritzinger (@peerst) which was a direct port of Erlang/OTPs C-implementation of EPMD.

* This code is not blessed for production use just yet.
* This code is only to show the implementation for a Pull Request.
