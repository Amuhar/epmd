Erlang Port Mapper Daemon
=========================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/psyeugenic/epmd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/psyeugenic/epmd)

An Erlang implmentation of Erlang/OTPs port mapper daemon.

The Erlang code was originally written by Peer Stritzinger (@peerst) which was a direct port of Erlang/OTPs C-implementation of EPMD.

* This code is not blessed for production use just yet.
